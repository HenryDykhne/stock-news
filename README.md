# STOCK NEWS
## Notes:
* The `run` method in the `StockNews` class is intended only for demonstration for m1 and thus breaks single responsibility.
* There is no persistance yet. In order to use features such as checking the news, one must first import a stock csv as an admin and check it in the same running instance.
## Setup and running instructions:
1. Open terminal.
2. Run following commands in terminal to build project: 
```
./gradlew build
./gradlew run --console=plain
```
